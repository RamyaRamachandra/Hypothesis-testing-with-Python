#### Introduction
As you've been learning, analysis of variance (commonly called ANOVA) is a group of statistical techniques that test the difference of means among three or more groups. It's a powerful tool for determining whether population means are different across groups and for answering a wide range of business questions.

In this activity, you are a data professional working with historical marketing promotion data. You will use the data to run a one-way ANOVA and a post hoc ANOVA test. Then, you will communicate your results to stakeholders. These experiences will help you make more confident recommendations in a professional setting.

In your dataset, each row corresponds to an independent marketing promotion, where your business uses TV, social media, radio, and influencer promotions to increase sales. You have previously provided insights about how different promotion types affect sales; now stakeholders want to know if sales are significantly different among various TV and influencer promotion types.

To address this request, a one-way ANOVA test will enable you to determine if there is a statistically significant difference in sales among groups. This includes:

* Using plots and descriptive statistics to select a categorical independent variable
* Creating and fitting a linear regression model with the selected categorical independent variable
* Checking model assumptions
* Performing and interpreting a one-way ANOVA test
* Comparing pairs of groups using an ANOVA post hoc test
* Interpreting model outputs and communicating the results to nontechnical stakeholders
